# Vehicle Detection, Density Analysis, and Ambulance Priority Traffic Control for Indian Traffic

## Problem Statement

India faces severe urban traffic congestion, especially in metropolitan and tier-2 cities where rapid urbanization has led to high vehicle density and irregular traffic flow. Traditional traffic management systems rely on fixed-time signals, which do not adapt dynamically to real-time traffic conditions. This results in inefficient utilization of road networks, longer waiting times, higher fuel consumption, and increased pollution.

Ambulances are often delayed due to traffic congestion. The lack of automated systems that can detect, prioritize, and clear routes for ambulances contributes to delayed response times, which can lead to loss of lives.

The challenge is to design and implement an AI-driven intelligent traffic management system that can:
- Accurately detect vehicles in real-time under diverse Indian traffic conditions (dense, heterogeneous, and chaotic).
- Perform vehicle density analysis at intersections for dynamic traffic light control.
- Detect ambulances and automatically prioritize their passage by controlling traffic signals.
- Handle diverse conditions such as low-light, occlusion, weather variations, and non-lane discipline traffic behavior common in India.

The solution should be cost-effective, scalable, and integrable with existing traffic infrastructure while leveraging modern AI/ML techniques for computer vision and decision-making.
